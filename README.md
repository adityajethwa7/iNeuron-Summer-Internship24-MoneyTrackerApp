# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# iNeuron-Summer-Internship24-MoneyTrackerApp

My name is Aditya Jethwa, a 6th semester Information Technology Engineering student at Devang Patel Institute of Advanced Technology and Research (DEPSTAR), affiliated with Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT) University. This past summer (2024), I had the opportunity to intern at iNeuron Intelligence Pvt Ltd. As part of my internship, I developed an Money Tracker App using React.js and Tailwind CSS.
This project aims to empower users to gain control over their finances by providing a user-friendly platform to track their income and expenses. The application leverages the power of React.js for a dynamic and interactive experience, while Tailwind CSS ensures a clean and responsive design across various devices.
In the following sections, I'll delve deeper into the functionalities, technical aspects, and the overall impact of this Expense Tracker App.
